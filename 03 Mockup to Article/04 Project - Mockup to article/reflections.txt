You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  1. What new skills have you learned?
  2. What has been easy?
  3. What has been difficult?
  4. How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

	I've already got some experience with web development, and have had an easy start. I honestly don't think I have learned much yet, though I'm hoping to. I'm taking this course in order to improve my skills and to expand my understanding of web development, and I'm confident that I will - in time. I don't like sounding superior, but I look forward to finishing up the basics and take on more challenging tasks. Till now the most difficult task has been duplicating this article - with all it's hard to spot visual formatting like superscript.

	I hope this answer is sufficient. Looks like a great course by the way! :)

	Have a nice day
